# Cathy Loerzel

This project is a single-page application designed as a personal website, a blog, and a landing page to promote Cathy Loerzel and her book, Redeeming Heartache. Its origin is as a simple frontend with basic API functionality (two contact forms).

### The current deployment is available [here](https://cathy-loerzel.vercel.app/).

## Custom API Solution

*(updated 08-19-2021)*

A custom API solution is under development for keeping track of various data throughout the site. The API needs to keep track of (at minimum) blog posts, testimonials for "Redeeming Heartache", email addresses from the subscribe form, and all the information submitted in the contact form.

### Blogs

Blogs encompass writing, podcasts, and videos of Cathy's teaching. Each blog is organized by category, and the ability to sort by topic should be added.

Blogs click through to an individual blog page, which displays the data for a single post in greater detail for the user to experience. The blog page is designed to display any of these three types of blog, and adjust what is displayed accordingly.

The blog post object is structured as follows:

- id: This is parameter read by the component from the URL. Unique identifier, required, will be auto generated in dashboard form if not provided.
- title: (required) The unique title of the blog to be displayed.
- category: (required) Currently, categories are: writing, prodcasts, teaching.
- topics: (required) A list of topics to categorize the blog, used in sorting cards.
- date: (required) Date the content was published, MM-DD-YYYY.
- text: (required) The description provided for the card to display, for example the first paragraph of the blog.
- img: (required) The banner image for the blog, should be 16x9.

- url: The clickthrough link for posts which are originally hosted elsewhere.
